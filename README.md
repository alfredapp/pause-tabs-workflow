## About

<!-- BEGIN ABOUT -->

Run `pauseall` to pause audio and video in tabs of all open web browers. `pauseothers` does the same except for the current tab. ⌘↵ makes it pause only tabs from the current browser.

You need to turn on `Allow JavaScript from Apple Events` in the browsers you want to control for the Workflow to work.
